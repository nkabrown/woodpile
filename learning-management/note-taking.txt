**How I Take Notes**

I utilize my working memory to toggle between producing the notes and
comprehending the material, or the tasks of copying and comprehending.

Note-taking is a dual process of producing notes and comprehending material that
makes large demands on our limited working memory. Note taking is a demanding
mental task of the focused mode of thinking.

"managing working memory is an essential component of effective note-taking"

Working memory includes short-term memory storage but it is also the capability
to transform information.

Ideal notetaking invests the limited resources of working memory in a balanced
way between understanding and production. Something approaching a balance is
best because it is inefficient to focus on one task or the other.

**What Are Ideal Notes?**

Notes are less about copying and more about thinking.

Notes should capture idea units and critical points.

**Optimizing Notes**

+ frameworks or organizational principles
+ generative activities that form connections between ideas
+ prefer to test yourself on notes than re-read your notes
+ interactive transformation of your notes is the optimal way to review your
  notes
+ review your notes right away and then practice spaced review

Big Questions
-------------

Are there ways to review my notes that engage my diffuse mode of thinking?
Are there ways to increase my working memory's capacity or its effectiveness.
