Two Ways of Thinking CHUNK

fact: There are two distinctly different ways of thinking associated with two mutually
exclusive brain states.

term: Focused mode thinking is associated with highly attentive brain states. It's
intense concentration seeking thought patterns to solve specific problems or understand
concepts.

term: Diffuse mode thinking is associated with resting brain states. It's unconscious
scanning and processing seeking to make connections between distant ideas.

Memory Systems CHUNK

fact: There are two major memory systems relevant to learning: working memory and long-term memory.

term: Working memory includes short-term memory storage but it is also the capability to transform information.

term: Long-term memory is extensive but sometimes inaccessible information storage

Chunking CHUNK

term: Chunking is a mental activity that helps you make meaningful connections between individual bits of information.

For example: "There are two sorts of reading. There is the sort we learned long ago, when we were five or six. The other
sort is reading with understanding, receiving the text on the right wavelength." Additional mental actions, such as chunking,
are required to make connections along the 'right wavelength'.
