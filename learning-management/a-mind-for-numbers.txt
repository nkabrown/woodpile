Two Ways of Thinking CHUNK

fact: There are two distinctly different ways of thinking associated with two mutually
exclusive brain states.

term: Focused mode thinking is associated with highly attentive brain states and is
intense concentration seeking thought patterns to solve specific problems or understand
concepts. (or) is intense concentration seeking thought patterns enabling us to take concepts in hand to solve specific problems.

'Concepts always constitute an organon: an instrument. We cannot think without them.' (Lacoste)

term: Diffuse mode thinking is associated with resting brain states and is unconscious
scanning and processing seeking to make connections between distant ideas and strengthening associations.

'...consciousness is not to be identified with any particular perceptual-cognitive
functions such as discriminative response to stimulation, perception, memory, or
the higher mental processes involved in judgement and problem-solving. All these
functions can take place outside of phenomenal awareness.'
(Kihlstrom - The Cognitive Unconscious)

Memory Systems CHUNK

fact: There are three aspects of our memory systems relevant to learning: working memory, retrospective memory, and prospective memory.

term: Working memory includes short-term memory storage but it is also the capability to transform information.

term: Retrospective memory

term: Prospective memory is the ability to remember to execute goals in the future.

Chunking CHUNK

term: Chunking is a mental activity that helps you make meaningful connections between individual bits of information.

For example: "There are two sorts of reading. There is the sort we learned long ago, when we were five or six. The other
sort is reading with understanding, receiving the text on the right wavelength." Additional mental actions, such as chunking,
are required to make connections along the 'right wavelength'.
