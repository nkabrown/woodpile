Will transcribing a book or lecture, word-for-word, help you to more effectively
store information in long-term memory?

While reading or listening what should I be alert to? Concepts or idea units.

a description of my first picture walk: it struck me as an attempt to discern the
semantics behind the structure of the chapter. Jump from structural device to
structural device that each exist to empahsize the main ideas and concepts:
subtitles, bold text, images that pictorally represent main ideas, textboxes,
and headings. It could conceivably all be one block of text, all of the same
size and font and shape. But our texts are not and there is meaning to be found
in the many constructive choices the author and bookmaker have made.

What is the role of imagination in learning?

Talk idea: AdventureTime - Why learning effectively is more like play than
punishment

The extra effort of seeking new words to describe the same concepts will lead to
stronger memories.
