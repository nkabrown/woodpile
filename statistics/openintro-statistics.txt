Data Structure CHUNK

term: Data matrix is a structure for organizing data where each row corresponds to a
unique case and each column corresponds to a variable.

Variable Types CHUNK

fact: Variables fall into one of two types, numerical or categorical

term: Numerical variables designate variables that can take a wide range of numerical
values and perform meaningful arithmetic operations on those values. If the variable has
only integer values it is a discrete numberical variable. If the variable is not resolved
to particular values it is a continuous numerical variable.

term: integers include the natural numbers, the negatives of the natural numbers, and zero

term: Categorical variables designate variables whose values indicate membership in one of
several possible categories, known as levels. If the levels are ordered or ranked it is an
ordinal categorical variable. If the levels are unordered it is a nominal categorical
variable.
